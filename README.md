# MERN Stack Registration and Login Form

This project is a secure Registration and Login form built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It leverages the power of **TanStack Query** for efficient and easy data fetching, caching, and updates in your React applications.

The form handling is managed by **Formik**, a small library that helps with the 3 most annoying parts: getting values in and out of form state, validation and error messages, and handling form submission.

For form validation, the project utilizes **Yup** - a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Yup schema forms a contract for our forms and provides clear, concise error messages making it easier for users to correct their input.

This project was created for **practice and learning purposes**, serving as a practical application of the MERN stack, TanStack Query, Formik, and Yup.
